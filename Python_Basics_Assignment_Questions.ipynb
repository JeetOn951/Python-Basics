        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "-> Python is a programming language that is very easy to read and write. People like it because its code looks almost like plain English, so beginners can understand it quickly. Also, it has lots of ready-made tools and libraries which help you build things faster, from websites to data science projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "-> An interpreter is a program that reads the Python code line by line and runs it. So, when you write Python code, the interpreter helps your computer understand and execute it step by step.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "-> Pre-defined keywords are special words in Python that have a fixed meaning. For example, if, else, while, for, True, False, etc. You can’t change what they do because Python uses them to understand your instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "-> No, you can’t use keywords as variable names. For example, you can’t make a variable named if or while because Python will get confused and think you are trying to write a condition or loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "-> Mutability means whether something can be changed after it’s created. If something is mutable, you can change its contents. If it’s immutable, you can’t change it.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "-> Lists are designed so you can add, remove, or change items in them. That’s why they are mutable. But tuples are made to stay the same once you create them. So, you can’t change what’s inside a tuple — it stays fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "-> '==' checks if the values are the same. For example, if two lists have the same items, == will say they are equal.\n",
        "is checks if they are the same object in memory. So, two different lists with the same items are equal (==), but they are not the same object (is).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "-> Logical operators are words like and, or, and not. They help you combine conditions. For example, you can check if two things are true at the same time using and, or check if at least one is true using or.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "-> Type casting means changing one data type into another. For example, turning an integer into a string, or a float into an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "-> Implicit type casting happens automatically — Python does it by itself. For example, if you add an integer and a float, Python will turn the integer into a float.\n",
        "Explicit type casting is when you do it yourself using functions like int(), float(), or str().\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "-> Conditional statements like if, elif, and else help your program make decisions. They check if something is true and then run some code based on that. It’s like giving your program a brain to choose what to do.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "-> elif means else if. It checks another condition if the first if is false. If that’s also false, it can check more elif conditions. So, it’s useful when you have many choices to check, one after another.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "-> A for loop is used when you know how many times you want to repeat something — like going through items in a list. A while loop repeats as long as a condition is true. You don’t always know how many times it will run.\n",
